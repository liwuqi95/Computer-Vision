function [circles] = getProposals(normals, p, numGuesses)
  % [circles] = getProposals(normals, p, numGuesses)
  % Attempt to produce up to numGuesses circle proposals from
  % the edgel data p and normals.  For typical data sets
  % we will be able to produce numGuesses proposals.  However,
  % on some datasets, say with only a few edgels, we may not be
  % able to generate any proposals.  In this case size(circles,1)
  % can be zero.
  % Input:
  %  normals - N x 2 edgel normals
  %  p         N x 2 edgel positions
  %  numGuesses - attempt to propose this number of circles.
  % Return:
  %   circles a P x 3 array, each row contains [x0(1) x0(2) r]
  %           with 0 <= P <= numGuesses.
